                    stranger who promised him a job in a big city. Instead, he was forced into child labor in a factory, working 
                    long hours in dangerous conditions for little to no pay. Ramesh's resilience was tested to the limit, but he 
                    drew strength from his love for his family and his determination to escape his tormentors. He managed to find 
                    a moment of opportunity and alerted the authorities, leading to his rescue.</p>

                    scholarship to study abroad. Upon arrival, she found herself trapped in a forced marriage, isolated from the outside 
                    world and subjected to constant abuse. Priya's love for learning and her intellectual curiosity became her lifeline. 
                    She secretly taught herself English, using books and scraps of paper she managed to obtain. With the help of a sympathetic 
                    teacher, she was able to reach out to a human rights organization and seek their assistance.</p>
